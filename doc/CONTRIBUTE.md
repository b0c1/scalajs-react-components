#Contribute

* There are no global rules for this project, follow whatever works for you.

* If you're working on new component please create an [issue](https://github.com/chandu0101/scalajs-react-components/issues), so that we can minimize duplicate works, and you may find other awesome contributors.

* If you want to create a wrapper for third party components (js/jsx world) then follow this tutorial [InteropWithThirdparty](https://github.com/chandu0101/scalajs-react-components/tree/master/doc/InteropWithThirdParty.md)

* To create a demo for your new component(like adding routes /pages /deps/..) check this [changelist](https://github.com/chandu0101/scalajs-react-components/commit/8619624d6de6be91dca7f6761c8ff48199084cf6) as an example.

* That's all , have fun , happy coding :)

* Keep in mind that some code is auto-generated (material-ui for now). File bug reports instead of PR for those
